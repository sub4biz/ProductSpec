ProductSpec is an open standard for software intent before implementation.

It gives teams a portable Markdown format for the product decision that comes before tickets, engineering plans, and code.

Use it when the work is consequential enough that intent needs to survive handoff: from humans to humans, from product to engineering, and from teams to AI agents.

```text
Product Spec -> Engineering Spec -> Code -> Evaluation -> Learning
what / why      how / plan / tasks   implementation   outcome
```

ProductSpec is neutral. It defines structure, section IDs, portable review annotations, calibration-example serialization, and portable decision traces. It does not define what makes a Product Spec good.

Design principle: structure the parts machines must execute or compare. Leave the parts humans must reason about readable.

ProductSpec can also act as the control file for agent-led work. The repo includes `skills/productspec/SKILL.md`, a loadable agent skill that tells coding agents how to read Product Specs, cite Acceptance Criteria, respect scope, and propose a Decision Trace when implementation diverges from intent.

Decision Trace is the optional companion standard for recording how consequential decisions, drift, revisions, and outcomes are handled over time.

```text
Intent -> Implementation -> Drift -> Decision Trace -> Revised Intent
```

## Living Specs

Product Specs are living documents. They should change when evidence, scope, design, acceptance criteria, or success metrics change.

`spec_revision` gives each meaningful revision a portable handle:

```yaml
spec_format_version: "0.1" # ProductSpec standard version
spec_revision: 1           # initial product intent
spec_revision: 2           # scope changed after design review
spec_revision: 3           # acceptance criteria updated before implementation
```

Git keeps the detailed history. `spec_revision` lets people and tools cite the intent revision they are using: a Jira ticket, an engineering spec, an AI agent loop, a pull request, or a Decision Trace.

See `examples/revisions/` for a Product Spec that evolves from revision 1 to revision 2.

## Quick Start

Validate a Product Spec with the published CLI:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec validate path/to/file.product-spec.md
```

Create a starter Product Spec:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec init my-feature.product-spec.md
```

Try an included example:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec validate examples/minimal.product-spec.md
```

Validate a Decision Trace:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec validate-trace examples/decision-traces/transcript-search.decision-trace.json
```

Use the GitHub Action in a repository:

```yaml
name: ProductSpec

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  validate-product-specs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: gokulrajaram/ProductSpec@main
        with:
          files: "docs/product-specs/**/*.product-spec.md"
          decision_traces: "docs/decision-traces/**/*.decision-trace.json"
```

## How To Contribute Without Coding

Product leaders and builders can shape ProductSpec without touching parser code:

- open a `General spec discussion` issue with an example from your product process
- propose a section vocabulary change when the default sections do not fit consequential work
- contribute an anonymized Product Spec example
- contribute a Decision Trace example showing how intent changed during implementation
- report confusing validator errors or adoption friction

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for exact issue and pull request steps.

## Example

Full Product Spec files include frontmatter such as `title`, optional `spec_revision`, `author`, and timestamps. This shortened example shows the section body.

## Problem

Support leads at B2B SaaS companies lose their morning planning window because urgent, account-risk tickets are buried among routine product questions.

## Hypothesis

If incoming tickets are automatically labeled by urgency, customer tier, and likely owner, support leads will respond to account-risk issues faster because the queue starts each day pre-sorted by consequence.

## Scope

```productspec-scope
in:
  - ticket ingestion
  - urgency labels
  - customer-tier lookup
  - owner recommendation
  - confidence score
  - reviewer override
  - audit log
out:
  - auto-replies
  - direct ticket reassignment
  - customer-visible status changes
cut:
  - custom routing rules
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```productspec-acceptance-criteria
- id: AC-1
  criterion: New tickets receive urgency, customer tier, suggested owner, confidence score, and model version within 60 seconds.
- id: AC-2
  criterion: Reviewers can override any label before it changes downstream workflow state.
```

```productspec-ai-evals
- id: EVAL-1
  type: llm_judge
  cases:
    - input: "Representative input for this eval."
      expected: "Expected behavior for this eval."
  evaluator: llm
  pass_threshold: 0.92
  checks:
    - urgency classification identifies account-risk tickets
```

## Success Metrics

```productspec-success-metrics
- id: SM-1
  metric: median_time_to_first_human_response
  target: "< 15 minutes"
  target_status: committed
  window: business hours
```
````

## Naming

- `ProductSpec` is the open standard, project, repository, and ecosystem for software intent.
- `Product Spec` is the artifact a person writes.

## When To Use ProductSpec

ProductSpec is not for every act of building. It is for consequential software work where intent needs to survive handoff.

For an individual builder, a Product Spec is useful when the work is complex, risky, long-lived, or being handed to an AI agent loop. For quick experiments, one-off scripts, or throwaway prototypes, it may be faster to brainstorm, build, and iterate directly.

For a team or organization, ProductSpec is most useful when coordination cost appears: multiple people, multiple agents, design and engineering handoffs, customer-facing launches, AI features with evals, or decisions that will need to be revisited later.

## Where This Sits

ProductSpec operates at the software intent layer: the what and why that come before engineering specs are written. This is where a team commits to the problem, hypothesis, scope, user experience, acceptance criteria, and success metrics.

OpenSpec and Spec Kit operate at the engineering spec layer. OpenSpec's flow is propose -> apply -> archive. Spec Kit's flow is constitution -> specify -> clarify -> plan -> tasks -> analyze -> implement. Those artifacts live in the repo and are consumed by AI agents to build code.

```text
Product Spec (ProductSpec) -> Engineering Spec (OpenSpec / Spec Kit) -> Code (agents)
what / why                       how / plan / tasks                         implementation
strategic intent                 technical decomposition                    running system
```

Both layers are SDD. Both use the spec as a control system. They serve different roles with different artifacts.

## Where ProductSpec Fits

ProductSpec does not replace Git, Jira, Linear, Figma, analytics tools, OpenSpec, Spec Kit, or AI coding agents.

It sits upstream of them.

```text
ProductSpec -> Engineering Spec -> Tasks -> Code -> Evaluation -> Learning
```

- Git stores implementation history. A Product Spec can live beside code in Git, but code commits should not be the first durable record of why the work exists.
- Jira and Linear store work history. A Product Spec can become epics, tickets, or tasks, but it should remain the durable statement of intent behind those tasks.
- Figma stores design artifacts. A Product Spec can link to prototypes, mockups, or screenshots through `user_experience`, but it does not replace the design source of truth.
- Analytics tools store outcome data.
- OpenSpec and Spec Kit turn intent into engineering plans.
- AI coding agents execute implementation tasks.
- ProductSpec stores the software intent behind the work: the problem, hypothesis, scope, acceptance criteria, and success metrics that downstream tools should preserve.

## Ecosystem

ProductSpec is meant to be implemented by many tools.

Current repo artifacts:

- `@productspec/parser`: TypeScript parser, validator, and CLI.
- JSON Schema for parsed Product Spec documents.
- Valid and invalid conformance fixtures.
- `starter-kit/`: copyable repo setup with Product Specs, Decision Traces, agent instructions, PR template, and CI.
- GitHub issue and pull request templates.
- Examples for AI features, consumer UX, enterprise workflows, internal APIs, and revision history.

Durable IDs are generated for the top-level items that tools execute or compare: `AC-1` for Acceptance Criteria, `SM-1` for Success Metrics, and `EVAL-1` for AI evals. Scope bullets, eval cases, optional eval checks, and prose/custom sections remain un-IDed. Tools that need to cite eval children should use positional references like `EVAL-1.case[2]`.

Success Metrics may be `committed` when the target is known, or `provisional` when the team knows the metric but needs post-launch baseline work before committing the threshold. Provisional targets must name a `target_owner`.

Natural integration points:

- Git and GitHub for versioned Product Specs, pull requests, and review.
- Jira and Linear for work tracking that links back to Product Spec revisions.
- Figma and prototypes through `user_experience`.
- OpenSpec and Spec Kit for downstream engineering specs.
- AI coding agents that build until Acceptance Criteria pass.
- Analytics and experiment tools that measure Success Metrics after launch.

Traceability uses two shapes:

- Frontmatter for stable document-level relationships such as `linked_github_repo` and `applies_to`.
- `## Related Artifacts` with a structured `productspec-related-artifacts` block for item-level links from `AC-<number>`, `SM-<number>`, or `EVAL-<number>` to issues, pull requests, eval runs, dashboards, designs, releases, or engineering specs.

Early ecosystem contributions are welcome: examples, importer/exporter experiments, editor integrations, CI validation actions, review tools, and mappings into engineering-spec systems.

## Canonical Sections

Mandatory sections, in order:

1. `problem`
2. `hypothesis`
3. `scope`
4. `acceptance_criteria`
5. `success_metrics`

Optional sections:

`user_experience`, `customer_truth`, `solution_alternatives`, `solution`, `strategic_positioning`, `adoption`, `pricing`, `risks`, `ai`, `open_questions`, `rollout`, `related_artifacts`

`user_experience` describes the externally observable experience of the work when there is one: for example, a prototype URL, mockup, design link, public deploy, Loom walkthrough, API documentation page, CLI demo, dashboard, or internal tool screen.

Custom sections use `custom-<kebab-name>`.

## Status

Version `0.1` is intentionally small. It is stable enough for tooling experiments, but still pre-1.0 while implementers learn what needs to change. See `docs/versioning.md` for compatibility expectations.

ProductSpec distinguishes the standard version from the document revision:

- `spec_format_version` tells tools which ProductSpec format the file uses.
- `spec_revision` is an optional positive integer for this particular product decision. It starts at `1` and increments when intent materially changes.

The v0.9 milestone includes conformance fixtures, a structured validator, examples, a CLI, optional `spec_revision` frontmatter, traceability fields, a loadable agent skill, a copyable repo starter kit, and first-class Decision Trace validation:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec validate examples/minimal.product-spec.md
```

To validate a Decision Trace:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec validate-trace examples/decision-traces/transcript-search.decision-trace.json
```

To create a starter Product Spec:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec init my-feature.product-spec.md
```

For local development from this repository:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/cli.js validate examples/minimal.product-spec.md
```

Or use the shortcut:

```bash
npm run validate -- examples/minimal.product-spec.md
```

To run the local `productspec` CLI without a global install:

```bash
npm run cli -- validate examples/minimal.product-spec.md
```

To link the CLI during development:

```bash
npm run link:cli
```

After linking, `productspec validate examples/minimal.product-spec.md` works if your npm
global binary directory is on `PATH`.

See `docs/validate-your-first-product-spec.md` for the first-run path and current validator checks.

See `docs/adoption.md` for a practical team setup across Git, Jira, Linear, Figma, CI, engineering specs, and AI coding agents.
