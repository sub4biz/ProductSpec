ProductSpec is the open standard for product intent. It acts as a Product Harness for AI-native software work: what to build, what not to build, how to prove completion, and when intent changes.

It gives teams and agents a portable way to define intent up front, attach evidence after work starts, and preserve what changed when reality disagreed.

Use it when consequential software work needs intent to survive handoff: from product to engineering, from humans to agents, and from implementation back to learning.

```text
Product Spec -> Engineering Spec -> Code -> Evaluation -> Learning
what / why      how / plan / tasks   implementation   outcome
```

For agent-led work, ProductSpec gives coding agents a product contract:

```text
Product Spec
  -> MCP tools
  -> coding agent
  -> implementation
  -> Agent Run receipt
  -> Related Artifacts
  -> Decision Trace
  -> revised Product Spec
```

Product Spec is the core artifact. Agent Run and Decision Trace are optional companion artifacts: use them when agents implement against a spec or when evidence changes the decision.

ProductSpec is neutral. It defines structure, section IDs, portable review annotations, calibration-example serialization, and portable decision traces. It does not define what makes a Product Spec good.

Design principle: structure the parts machines must execute or compare. Leave the parts humans must reason about readable.

ProductSpec acts as a Product Harness for agent-led work. The Product Spec tells Claude, Codex, Cursor, and other coding agents what to build, what not to build, how to prove completion, and when to stop and re-plan. For those agents, ProductSpec provides an intent harness: structured context, scope guardrails, acceptance criteria, evals, evidence targets, and revision checks. The repo includes `skills/productspec/SKILL.md`, a loadable agent skill that tells coding agents how to read Product Specs, cite Acceptance Criteria, respect scope, and propose a Decision Trace when implementation diverges from intent. `skills/productspec-authoring/SKILL.md` covers the other direction: writing a Product Spec, validating it, and converting an existing PRD into one. Both are installable with `npx skills add gokulrajaram/ProductSpec`.

Agent Run is the optional companion artifact for recording what happened when an agent used ProductSpec as its product contract: the pinned spec revision, checked criteria and evals, linked evidence, drift status, and completion claim.

Decision Trace is the optional companion standard for recording how consequential decisions, drift, revisions, and outcomes are handled over time.

```text
Intent -> Implementation -> Drift -> Decision Trace -> Revised Intent
```

## What Agents Can Do Today

With the parser, CLI, MCP server, and companion artifacts in this repo, agents can:

- validate Product Specs before planning or coding
- pin `spec_revision` and content hash at the start of a work session
- read Product Summary, Scope, Acceptance Criteria, AI Evals, Success Metrics, and Related Artifacts as structured data
- resolve a folder of specs into buildable, blocked, and ordered work
- ask what evidence is expected for each `AC-`, `EVAL-`, and `SM-` item
- check whether the Product Spec changed before claiming completion
- draft an Agent Run receipt
- record drift or learning through Decision Trace

ProductSpec does not tell the agent how to code. It tells the agent what intent it is accountable to.

## Intent And Evidence

ProductSpec defines what should be built and why.

Evidence shows what happened after work started: pull requests, tests, eval runs, dashboards, analytics snapshots, releases, and support signals.

Use `Related Artifacts` to attach evidence to durable ProductSpec IDs:

- `AC-<number>`: implementation evidence
- `EVAL-<number>`: model behavior evidence
- `SM-<number>`: post-launch outcome evidence

Updating evidence links does not automatically require a `spec_revision` bump. Bump `spec_revision` when evidence changes the meaning of the product intent: scope, acceptance criteria, user experience, success metrics, or the underlying bet. Use Decision Trace when evidence changes the product decision.

ProductSpec does not collect traces or run evals. It gives evidence a stable intent target.

## Living Specs

Product Specs are living documents. They should change when evidence, scope, design, acceptance criteria, or success metrics change.

`spec_revision` gives each meaningful revision a portable handle:

```yaml
spec_format_version: "0.1" # ProductSpec standard version
spec_revision: 1           # initial product intent
spec_revision: 2           # scope changed after design review
spec_revision: 3           # acceptance criteria updated before implementation
```

Git keeps the detailed history. `spec_revision` lets people and tools cite the intent revision they are using: a Jira ticket, an engineering spec, an AI agent loop, a pull request, or a Decision Trace.

See `examples/revisions/` for a Product Spec that evolves from revision 1 to revision 2.

## Quick Start

If you want to use ProductSpec as a Product Harness for coding agents, start here:

- [Get started with agents](docs/get-started-with-agents.md): install the skills, convert a PRD, validate in CI, implement from a Product Spec, and record drift.
- [Use the MCP server](docs/agent-mcp.md): expose Product Specs to coding agents as structured tools.
- [Install MCP in Claude or Cursor](docs/mcp-install.md): generate a copy-pasteable MCP client config.
- [5-minute Product Harness demo](docs/agent-harness-demo.md): see Product Spec, MCP, Agent Run, and Decision Trace working together.
- [Product Harness](docs/product-harness.md): the outer-loop frame around coding agents and engineering specs.
- [Agent Handoff](docs/agent-handoff.md): generate an implementation brief from a Product Spec without making handoff a canonical spec section.
- [60-second demo script](docs/demo-script.md): record the ProductSpec loop closing in a short GIF or Loom.
- [Status badge spec](docs/status-badge.md): factual badge shapes for valid specs, run receipts, evidence, and revisions.
- [Evidence loop](docs/evidence-loop.md): connect Product Specs to implementation, evals, metrics, and Decision Trace.
- [Agent Run](docs/agent-run.md): record one Claude, Codex, Cursor, or other agent execution against a pinned Product Spec.

1. Try the Product Harness demo:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec validate examples/harness-demo/checkout-notifications.product-spec.md
```

2. Generate an Agent Handoff:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec handoff examples/product-harness/video-transcript.product-spec.md
```

3. Start the MCP server:

```bash
npx --yes -p @productspec/parser@latest productspec mcp
```

Generate a Claude or Cursor MCP config:

```bash
npx --yes -p @productspec/parser@latest productspec mcp-config claude
```

4. Ask Claude, Codex, Cursor, or another MCP-aware agent to implement against the Product Spec:

```text
Use ProductSpec MCP before coding.
Validate examples/harness-demo/checkout-notifications.product-spec.md, call begin_spec_session, load Product Summary, Scope, Acceptance Criteria, AI Evals, Success Metrics, Related Artifacts, and Agent Handoff.
Stay inside scope.in, avoid scope.out and scope.cut, verify every AC- and EVAL- item, call check_spec_session before claiming done, and draft an Agent Run receipt.
```

5. Draft the run receipt:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec init-run examples/harness-demo/checkout-notifications.product-spec.md /tmp/checkout-notifications.agent-run.json
```

5. Validate the checked-in example receipt and trace:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec validate-run examples/harness-demo/checkout-notifications.agent-run.json
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec validate-trace examples/harness-demo/checkout-notifications.decision-trace.json
```

Create a starter Product Spec:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec init my-feature.product-spec.md
```

Prefer an editor?

You can also draft and validate Product Specs in the free browser editor at [ProductSpec.io](https://productspec.io). The open standard does not require the hosted editor.

Resolve a folder of specs into a build graph:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec graph conformance/graph
```

## Status Badges

ProductSpec badges should report facts, not subjective quality scores.

```text
ProductSpec: valid
ProductSpec: rev 3
Agent Run: recorded
Evidence: 4 linked artifacts
ProductSpec graph: buildable
```

See [`docs/status-badge.md`](docs/status-badge.md) for the recommended badge vocabulary.

Use the GitHub Action in a repository:

```yaml
name: ProductSpec

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  validate-product-specs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: gokulrajaram/ProductSpec@main
        with:
          files: "docs/product-specs/**/*.product-spec.md"
          decision_traces: "docs/decision-traces/**/*.decision-trace.json"
          agent_runs: "docs/agent-runs/**/*.agent-run.json"
```

## How To Contribute Without Coding

Product leaders and builders can shape ProductSpec without touching parser code:

- open a `General spec discussion` issue with an example from your product process
- propose a section vocabulary change when the default sections do not fit consequential work
- contribute an anonymized Product Spec example
- contribute a Decision Trace example showing how intent changed during implementation
- report confusing validator errors or adoption friction

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for exact issue and pull request steps.

## Example

Full Product Spec files include frontmatter such as `title`, optional `spec_revision`, `author`, and timestamps. This shortened example shows the section body.

````markdown
## Problem

Support leads at B2B SaaS companies lose their morning planning window because urgent, account-risk tickets are buried among routine product questions.

## Hypothesis

If incoming tickets are automatically labeled by urgency, customer tier, and likely owner, support leads will respond to account-risk issues faster because the queue starts each day pre-sorted by consequence.

## Product Summary

An AI support triage workflow labels incoming tickets by urgency, customer tier, likely owner, and confidence so support leads can start from an ordered queue.

## Scope

```productspec-scope
in:
  - Include ticket ingestion in this version.
  - Include urgency labels in this version.
  - Include customer-tier lookup in this version.
  - Include owner recommendation in this version.
  - Include confidence score in this version.
  - Include reviewer override in this version.
  - Include audit log in this version.
out:
  - Do not build auto-replies in this version.
  - Do not build direct ticket reassignment in this version.
  - Do not build customer-visible status changes in this version.
cut:
  - Cut custom routing rules from the first version if implementation time is tight.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```productspec-acceptance-criteria
- id: AC-1
  criterion: New tickets receive urgency, customer tier, suggested owner, confidence score, and model version within 60 seconds.
- id: AC-2
  criterion: Reviewers can override any label before it changes downstream workflow state.
```

```productspec-ai-evals
- id: EVAL-1
  type: llm_judge
  cases:
    - input: "Representative input for this eval."
      expected: "Expected behavior for this eval."
  evaluator: llm
  pass_threshold: 0.92
  checks:
    - urgency classification identifies account-risk tickets
```

## Success Metrics

```productspec-success-metrics
- id: SM-1
  metric: median_time_to_first_human_response
  target: "< 15 minutes"
  target_status: committed
  window: business hours
```
````

See [examples/ai-support-triage.product-spec.md](examples/ai-support-triage.product-spec.md) for the complete version.

## Naming

- `ProductSpec` is the open standard, project, repository, and ecosystem for software intent.
- `Product Spec` is the artifact a person writes.

## When To Use ProductSpec

ProductSpec is not for every act of building. It is for consequential software work where intent needs to survive handoff.

For an individual builder, a Product Spec is useful when the work is complex, risky, long-lived, or being handed to an AI agent loop. For quick experiments, one-off scripts, or throwaway prototypes, it may be faster to brainstorm, build, and iterate directly.

For a team or organization, ProductSpec is most useful when coordination cost appears: multiple people, multiple agents, design and engineering handoffs, customer-facing launches, AI features with evals, or decisions that will need to be revisited later.

## Where This Sits

ProductSpec operates at the software intent layer: the what and why that come before engineering specs are written. This is where a team commits to the problem, hypothesis, product summary, scope, user experience, acceptance criteria, and success metrics.

OpenSpec and Spec Kit operate at the engineering spec layer. OpenSpec's flow is propose -> apply -> archive. Spec Kit's flow is constitution -> specify -> clarify -> plan -> tasks -> analyze -> implement. Those artifacts live in the repo and are consumed by AI agents to build code.

```text
Product Spec (ProductSpec) -> Engineering Spec (OpenSpec / Spec Kit) -> Code (agents)
what / why                       how / plan / tasks                         implementation
strategic intent                 technical decomposition                    running system
```

Both layers are SDD. Both use the spec as a control system. They serve different roles with different artifacts.

## Where ProductSpec Fits

ProductSpec does not replace Git, Jira, Linear, Figma, analytics tools, OpenSpec, Spec Kit, or AI coding agents.

It sits upstream of them.

```text
ProductSpec -> Engineering Spec -> Tasks -> Code -> Evaluation -> Learning
```

- Git stores implementation history. A Product Spec can live beside code in Git, but code commits should not be the first durable record of why the work exists.
- Jira and Linear store work history. A Product Spec can become epics, tickets, or tasks, but it should remain the durable statement of intent behind those tasks.
- Figma stores design artifacts. A Product Spec can link to prototypes, mockups, or screenshots through `user_experience`, but it does not replace the design source of truth.
- Analytics tools store outcome data.
- OpenSpec and Spec Kit turn intent into engineering plans.
- AI coding agents execute implementation tasks.
- ProductSpec stores the software intent behind the work: the problem, hypothesis, product summary, scope, acceptance criteria, and success metrics that downstream tools should preserve.

## Ecosystem

ProductSpec is meant to be implemented by many tools.

Current repo artifacts:

- `@productspec/parser`: TypeScript parser, validator, and CLI.
- `skills/productspec` and `skills/productspec-authoring`: loadable agent skills for implementing from a Product Spec and for writing one.
- JSON Schema for parsed Product Spec documents.
- Valid and invalid conformance fixtures.
- `starter-kit/`: copyable repo setup with Product Specs, Agent Runs, Decision Traces, agent instructions, PR template, and CI.
- GitHub issue and pull request templates.
- Examples for AI features, consumer UX, enterprise workflows, internal APIs, and revision history.

Durable IDs are generated for the top-level items that tools execute or compare: `AC-1` for Acceptance Criteria, `SM-1` for Success Metrics, and `EVAL-1` for AI evals. Scope bullets, eval cases, optional eval checks, and prose/custom sections remain un-IDed. Tools that need to cite eval children should use positional references like `EVAL-1.case[2]`.

Success Metrics may be `committed` when the target is known, or `provisional` when the team knows the metric but needs post-launch baseline work before committing the threshold. Provisional targets must name a `target_owner`.

Natural integration points:

- Git and GitHub for versioned Product Specs, pull requests, and review.
- Jira and Linear for work tracking that links back to Product Spec revisions.
- Figma and prototypes through `user_experience`.
- OpenSpec and Spec Kit for downstream engineering specs.
- AI coding agents that build until Acceptance Criteria pass.
- Analytics and experiment tools that measure Success Metrics after launch.

Traceability uses two shapes:

- Frontmatter for stable document-level relationships such as `linked_github_repo` and `applies_to`.
- `## Related Artifacts` with a structured `productspec-related-artifacts` block for item-level links from `AC-<number>`, `SM-<number>`, or `EVAL-<number>` to issues, pull requests, eval runs, dashboards, designs, releases, or engineering specs.

Early ecosystem contributions are welcome: examples, importer/exporter experiments, editor integrations, CI validation actions, review tools, and mappings into engineering-spec systems.

## Canonical Sections

Mandatory sections, in order:

1. `problem`
2. `hypothesis`
3. `product_summary`
4. `scope`
5. `acceptance_criteria`
6. `success_metrics`

Optional sections:

`user_experience`, `customer_truth`, `solution_alternatives`, `solution`, `strategic_positioning`, `adoption`, `pricing`, `risks`, `ai`, `open_questions`, `rollout`, `related_artifacts`

`user_experience` describes the externally observable experience of the work when there is one: for example, a prototype URL, mockup, design link, public deploy, Loom walkthrough, API documentation page, CLI demo, dashboard, or internal tool screen.

Custom sections use `custom-<kebab-name>`.

## Status

Version `0.1` is intentionally small. It is stable enough for tooling experiments, but still pre-1.0 while implementers learn what needs to change. See `docs/versioning.md` for compatibility expectations.

ProductSpec distinguishes the standard version from the document revision:

- `spec_format_version` tells tools which ProductSpec format the file uses.
- `spec_revision` is an optional positive integer for this particular product decision. It starts at `1` and increments when intent materially changes.

The current v0.x standard includes conformance fixtures, a structured validator, examples, a CLI, optional `spec_revision` frontmatter, traceability fields, an MCP server, a loadable agent skill, a copyable repo starter kit, generated Agent Handoffs, Decision Trace validation, and Agent Run drafting and validation:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec validate examples/minimal.product-spec.md
```

To validate a Decision Trace:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec validate-trace examples/decision-traces/transcript-search.decision-trace.json
```

To validate an Agent Run:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec validate-run examples/agent-ready-repo/docs/agent-runs/transcript-search.agent-run.json
```

To draft an Agent Run from a Product Spec:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec init-run examples/minimal.product-spec.md examples/minimal.agent-run.json
```

To generate an Agent Handoff from a Product Spec:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec handoff examples/product-harness/video-transcript.product-spec.md
```

To create a starter Product Spec:

```bash
npm exec --package @productspec/parser -- productspec init my-feature.product-spec.md
```

For local development from this repository:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/cli.js validate examples/minimal.product-spec.md
```

Or use the shortcut:

```bash
npm run validate -- examples/minimal.product-spec.md
```

To run the local `productspec` CLI without a global install:

```bash
npm run cli -- validate examples/minimal.product-spec.md
```

To link the CLI during development:

```bash
npm run link:cli
```

After linking, `productspec validate examples/minimal.product-spec.md` works if your npm
global binary directory is on `PATH`.

See `docs/validate-your-first-product-spec.md` for the first-run path and current validator checks.

See `docs/adoption.md` for a practical team setup across Git, Jira, Linear, Figma, CI, engineering specs, and AI coding agents.
