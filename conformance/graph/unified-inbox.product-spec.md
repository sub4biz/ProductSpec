## Problem

Handoffs need somewhere to land, and operators need one queue instead of one tab per channel.

## Hypothesis

If every channel lands in one queue, operators stop tabbing between tools and first response time drops.

## Product Summary

This Product Spec describes the product behavior, user-facing shape, and implementation boundaries for the work.

## Scope

In: one queue across channels, with handoff landings and contact records attached.

Out: analytics on queue performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

```productspec-acceptance-criteria
- id: AC-1
  criterion: Given handoffs from two different channels, when an operator opens the inbox, then both appear in one queue with their contact records attached.
```

## Success Metrics

```productspec-success-metrics
- id: SM-1
  metric: median_first_response_time
  target: "<= 5 minutes"
  window: weekly
