## Problem

Hard conversations need a human, and today nothing decides when or carries the context over.

## Hypothesis

If the handoff fires on extracted signals and carries the whole conversation, humans start warm instead of cold.

## Product Summary

This Product Spec describes the product behavior, user-facing shape, and implementation boundaries for the work.

## Scope

In: signal-triggered handoff with full context transfer.

Out: routing rules per team, which the inbox owns.

## Acceptance Criteria

```productspec-acceptance-criteria
- id: AC-1
  criterion: Given a conversation crosses the handoff threshold, when a human takes over, then the full history and extracted signals are visible to them.
```

## Success Metrics

```productspec-success-metrics
- id: SM-1
  metric: handoffs_with_full_context
  target: ">= 95%"
  window: weekly
