## Problem

Backend engineers lose release time during traffic spikes because the current cache layer has inconsistent invalidation behavior and no clear rollback path.

## Hypothesis

If the platform cache moves to a versioned invalidation model with a documented rollback path, backend teams will ship high-traffic features with fewer release freezes because cache behavior becomes predictable during deploys.

## Product Summary

A platform cache migration gives service teams versioned cache keys, rollback guidance, metrics, and migration instructions.

## Scope

```productspec-scope
in:
  - Include versioned cache keys in this version.
  - migration adapter for existing read paths
  - Include rollback runbook in this version.
  - Include deploy-time metrics dashboard in this version.
  - Include service owner migration guide in this version.
out:
  - Do not build rewriting all service caches in this version.
  - Do not build changing database query shapes in this version.
  - Do not build cross-region cache replication in this version.
cut:
  - Cut automatic per-service migration from the first version if implementation time is tight.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```productspec-acceptance-criteria
- id: AC-1
  criterion: Existing read paths continue to return the same payload shape during migration.
- id: AC-2
  criterion: Service owners can opt into versioned cache keys behind a feature flag.
- id: AC-3
  criterion: Rollback restores the prior cache read path without data migration.
- id: AC-4
  criterion: The deploy dashboard shows cache hit rate, miss rate, error rate, and rollback status.
- id: AC-5
  criterion: The migration guide includes one worked service example.
```

## Success Metrics

```productspec-success-metrics
- id: SM-1
  metric: cache_related_release_freeze_count
  target: "0"
  window: 30 days after migration launch
- id: SM-2
  metric: migrated_service_count
  target: ">= 5 services"
  window: 45 days after launch
```
