## Problem

Sales managers miss customer calls when browser notifications are hidden during back-to-back meetings.

## Hypothesis

If calendar reminders can escalate to SMS for high-priority meetings, sales managers will miss fewer customer calls because the reminder reaches them on the device they are actually checking.

## Product Summary

A calendar reminder product sends high-priority SMS reminders for meetings a user is likely to miss.

## Scope

```productspec-scope

  - Include Google Calendar connection in this version.

  - Do not build full scheduling assistant in this version.
  - Do not build team admin controls in this version.

  - Cut WhatsApp reminders from the first version if implementation time is tight.
  - Cut custom reminder templates from the first version if implementation time is tight.
