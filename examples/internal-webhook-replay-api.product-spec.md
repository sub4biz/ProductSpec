## Problem

Developer support engineers cannot safely replay failed customer webhooks without asking an infrastructure engineer to run manual database queries and scripts.

## Hypothesis

If support engineers have a permissioned internal API for replaying failed webhooks, customers will recover integrations faster because the support team can resolve common delivery failures without engineering escalation.

## Product Summary

An internal webhook replay API lets authorized operators safely replay failed webhook deliveries with auditability and idempotency.

## Scope

```productspec-scope
in:
  - internal API endpoint for replaying one failed webhook event by ID
  - Include permission check in this version.
  - Include replay audit log in this version.
  - Include idempotency guard in this version.
  - structured success or failure response
out:
  - Do not build customer-facing UI in this version.
  - Do not build bulk replay in this version.
  - Do not build replay scheduling in this version.
  - Do not build editing payloads before replay in this version.
  - replaying events older than 30 days
cut:
  - Cut automatic retry policy changes from the first version if implementation time is tight.
  - Cut customer self-serve replay from the first version if implementation time is tight.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```productspec-acceptance-criteria
- id: AC-1
  criterion: Given a support engineer with `webhook_replay` permission, when they call the replay endpoint with a failed webhook event ID, the system enqueues exactly one replay job.
- id: AC-2
  criterion: Given a user without `webhook_replay` permission, the endpoint returns `403` and does not enqueue a replay job.
- id: AC-3
  criterion: Given an event that has already been replayed in the last 10 minutes, the endpoint returns the existing replay job ID instead of creating a duplicate job.
- id: AC-4
  criterion: Given an event older than 30 days, the endpoint returns a clear `event_not_replayable` error.
- id: AC-5
  criterion: Every replay attempt records actor ID, event ID, customer ID, replay job ID, timestamp, and result in the audit log.
- id: AC-6
  criterion: API evals: on a fixture set covering success, permission failure, duplicate replay, expired event, and missing event, the endpoint returns the expected status code and machine-readable error code in 100% of cases.
```
