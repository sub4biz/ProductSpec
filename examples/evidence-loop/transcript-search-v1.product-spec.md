## Problem

Researchers lose time finding exact quotes in long video transcripts because the current transcript page only supports browser text search inside one open page.

## Hypothesis

If researchers can search a transcript and copy timestamped passages from the result list, they will cite video sources faster because the product gives them the exact quote and source location together.

## Product Summary

A transcript search feature lets researchers search a single generated transcript, copy timestamped passages, and attach evidence after launch.

## Scope

```productspec-scope
in:
  - Include single-transcript keyword search in this version.
  - Include timestamped result links in this version.
  - Include copy passage with timestamp in this version.
out:
  - Do not build semantic search in this version.
  - Do not build cross-video search in this version.
cut:
  - Cut speaker label extraction from the first version if implementation time is tight.
```

## User Experience

https://example.com/transcript-search-prototype

## Acceptance Criteria

```productspec-acceptance-criteria
- id: AC-1
  criterion: When a user searches the current transcript by phrase, the page shows matching passages with timestamps.
- id: AC-2
  criterion: When a user copies a matching passage, the copied text includes the video title and timestamp.
```

```productspec-ai-evals
- id: EVAL-1
  type: contains
  cases:
    - input: "Find the quote about product judgment."
      expected: "product judgment"
    - input: "Find the passage about compounding product experience."
      expected: "compounding product experience"
  evaluator: deterministic
  pass_threshold: 1
  checks:
    - result contains the requested phrase
    - result includes the timestamp for the passage
```

## Success Metrics

```productspec-success-metrics
- id: SM-1
  metric: median_time_to_copy_timestamped_quote
  target: "< 2 minutes"
  target_status: committed
  window: first search session within 14 days after launch
```
