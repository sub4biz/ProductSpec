## Problem

Support leads at B2B SaaS companies cannot trust their daily SLA dashboard because ticket events arrive late, reopen events are counted inconsistently, and the dashboard does not show when the underlying pipeline is stale.

## Hypothesis

If support leads get a trustworthy daily SLA dataset with freshness, reopen handling, and visible data-quality status, they will make staffing and escalation decisions earlier because the morning dashboard will reflect yesterday's ticket reality.

## Product Summary

A support SLA analytics pipeline handles late ticket events, reopen logic, and historical backfill so teams can measure SLA performance accurately.

## Scope

```productspec-scope
in:
  - Produce a daily SLA fact table for first response and resolution time.
  - Include late-arriving ticket event handling in this version.
  - Include reopen event logic in this version.
  - Include 90-day historical backfill in this version.
  - Surface pipeline freshness and failure status on the dashboard.
out:
  - Do not build agent performance compensation rules in this version.
  - Do not build customer-facing SLA reporting in this version.
  - Do not build real-time streaming updates in this version.
cut:
  - Cut predictive staffing recommendations from the first version if implementation time is tight.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```productspec-acceptance-criteria
- id: AC-1
  criterion: The pipeline produces a daily SLA fact table by 06:00 local workspace time for every active support workspace.
- id: AC-2
  criterion: Late-arriving ticket events are incorporated into the next daily run and update the affected SLA rows without duplicating tickets.
- id: AC-3
  criterion: Reopened tickets are counted against resolution SLA only when the reopen event occurs within 7 days of the original resolution.
- id: AC-4
  criterion: When the backfill job runs, it rebuilds the prior 90 days and reports row counts, failed workspace count, and completion timestamp.
- id: AC-5
  criterion: Dashboard users can see whether the SLA dataset is fresh, delayed, or failed before reading the metric cards.
```

## Success Metrics

```productspec-success-metrics

  metric: support_lead_dashboard_trust
  target: ">= 80% of surveyed support leads agree the SLA dashboard is reliable for morning staffing decisions"
  target_status: provisional
  target_owner: "Support analytics PM"
  window: first 30 days after launch
- id: SM-3
  metric: manual_sla_export_requests
