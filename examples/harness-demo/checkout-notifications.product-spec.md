## Problem

Store operators lose recoverable orders because checkout failures are visible only in logs, not in the operator workflow where they can respond quickly.

## Hypothesis

If store operators receive a clear notification when a payment failure blocks checkout, they will recover more orders because they can contact the buyer or fix configuration issues before the buyer abandons the purchase.

## Product Summary

A checkout notification system emails failed-payment shoppers with a retry link while staying inside the first-version notification scope.

## Scope

```productspec-scope
in:
  - payment failure detection from checkout worker events
  - operator notification in the admin order timeline
  - Include retry payment action link in this version.
  - email notification for high-value failed orders
out:
  - Do not build SMS notifications in this version.
  - Do not build automatic discount offers in this version.
  - Do not build fraud review changes in this version.
cut:
  - Cut multi-store notification routing from the first version if implementation time is tight.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```productspec-acceptance-criteria
- id: AC-1
  criterion: A failed payment event creates one admin timeline notification for the affected order.
- id: AC-2
  criterion: The notification includes failure reason, buyer email, order value, and retry payment link.
- id: AC-3
  criterion: Orders above $500 also send one operator email within 5 minutes.
- id: AC-4
  criterion: Duplicate payment failure events for the same order do not create duplicate notifications within 30 minutes.
```

    - input: "payment_failed reason=card_declined order_total=742 buyer=buyer@example.com"
      expected: "Notification includes card_declined, $742, buyer@example.com, and retry payment."
    - input: "payment_failed reason=insufficient_funds order_total=42 buyer=buyer@example.com"
      expected: "Timeline notification is created, but high-value email is not sent."
