## Problem

Support leads at B2B SaaS companies lose their morning planning window because account-risk tickets are buried among routine product questions.

## Hypothesis

If incoming tickets are automatically labeled by urgency, customer tier, and likely owner, support leads will respond to account-risk issues faster because the queue starts each day pre-sorted by consequence.

## Product Summary

A second support triage version adds customer-tier context, reviewer override, and audit logging while keeping customer-facing actions out of scope.

## Scope

```productspec-scope
in:
  - Ingest tickets from the helpdesk API.
  - Include urgency labels in this version.
  - Include customer-tier lookup in this version.
  - Include owner recommendation in this version.
  - Include confidence score in this version.
  - Include reviewer override in this version.
  - Include audit log in this version.
out:
  - Do not build auto-replies in this version.
  - Do not build direct ticket reassignment in this version.
  - Do not build customer-visible status changes in this version.
  - Do not build custom routing rules in this version.
cut:
  - Cut multi-language classification from the first version if implementation time is tight.
  - Cut customer-specific routing policy configuration from the first version if implementation time is tight.
```

## User Experience

## Acceptance Criteria

```productspec-acceptance-criteria
- id: AC-1
  criterion: When a new ticket arrives, it receives urgency, customer tier, suggested owner, confidence score, and model version within 60 seconds.
- id: AC-2
  criterion: Reviewers can override any label before it changes downstream workflow state.
- id: AC-3
  criterion: When a label has confidence below 0.75, it is marked `needs_review` and does not trigger escalation.
- id: AC-4
  criterion: When an AI-generated label is created, it stores ticket ID, model version, input redaction status, confidence, reviewer action, and timestamp.
```

```productspec-ai-evals
- id: EVAL-1
  type: llm_judge
  cases:
    - input: "Representative input for this eval."
      expected: "Expected behavior for this eval."
  evaluator: llm
  pass_threshold: 0.92
  checks:
    - urgency classification identifies account-risk tickets
    - recall for account-risk tickets is at least 90%
    - owner recommendation matches the expected support queue
```
