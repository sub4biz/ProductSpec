## Problem

Treasury teams at mid-size lenders track loan covenants — debt-service coverage, leverage, security cover — for dozens of borrowings in spreadsheets. Covenant values are retyped by hand from other reports, reviews happen days before lender deadlines, and a mistyped or missed covenant can trigger default clauses on the facility. The team that borrows the money finds out about a breach when the lender does.

## Hypothesis

If covenant compliance is computed automatically from live portfolio data instead of typed into a tracker, treasury leads will catch at-risk covenants before review deadlines because the system flags breaches when the underlying data changes, not when a person remembers to check.

## Product Summary

A covenant monitoring workflow shows lenders current covenant status and cannot-compute states when required source data is missing or stale.

## Scope

```productspec-scope
in:
  - Show a covenant register per borrowing with type, threshold, and review cadence.
  - Compute covenant values automatically from existing repayment and outstanding-balance data.
  - Alert treasury leads about breaches and near-breaches ahead of lender review deadlines.
  - Require reviewer confirmation with a full audit trail before logging covenant status.
out:
  - Do not build lender-facing reporting portal in this version.
  - Do not build covenant negotiation or amendment workflows in this version.
  - Do not build automatic communication to lenders in this version.
cut:
  - Cut manual entry of computed covenant values because the system already holds the source data and typed values reintroduce spreadsheet failure modes.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```productspec-acceptance-criteria
- id: AC-1
  criterion: When a treasury user opens a borrowing, the page displays each covenant with the current computed value, threshold, headroom remaining, and source-data timestamp.
- id: AC-2
  criterion: When a computed covenant value crosses its configured near-breach threshold, the treasury lead receives an alert at least 10 business days before the lender review date.
- id: AC-3
  criterion: A reviewer can confirm or dispute a computed value before it enters the compliance log, and a dispute requires a written reason.
- id: AC-4
  criterion: The compliance log records the covenant, computed value, source-data timestamps, reviewer, decision, and decision time for every review cycle.
- id: AC-5
  criterion: If source data required for a computation is missing or older than 2 business days, the covenant shows a cannot-compute state naming the missing input instead of presenting a stale value.
```

```productspec-ai-evals
- id: EVAL-1
  type: exact_match
  evaluator: deterministic
  cases:
    - input: "Compute DSCR covenant for borrowing B-001 where repayment data timestamp is 3 business days old."
      expected: "cannot-compute: repayment_data_stale"
    - input: "Compute leverage covenant for borrowing B-002 where outstanding-balance data is missing."
      expected: "cannot-compute: outstanding_balance_missing"
  pass_threshold: 1.0
  checks:
    - stale source data triggers cannot-compute state rather than a computed value
    - cannot-compute response names the specific missing or stale input
```
