## Problem

Support leads at B2B SaaS companies lose their morning planning window because urgent, account-risk tickets are buried among routine product questions.

## Hypothesis

If incoming tickets are automatically labeled by urgency, customer tier, and likely owner, support leads will respond to account-risk issues faster because the queue starts each day pre-sorted by consequence.

## Product Summary

An AI support triage system labels tickets by urgency, customer tier, likely owner, confidence, and reviewer override state before escalation.

## Scope

```productspec-scope
in:
  - ticket ingestion from the helpdesk API
  - Include urgency labels in this version.
  - Include customer-tier lookup in this version.
  - Include owner recommendation in this version.
  - Include confidence score in this version.
  - Include reviewer override in this version.
  - Include audit log in this version.
out:
  - Do not build auto-replies in this version.
  - Do not build direct ticket reassignment in this version.
  - Do not build customer-visible status changes in this version.
  - training on private ticket bodies outside the customer's workspace
cut:
  - Cut multi-language classification from the first version if implementation time is tight.
  - Cut custom team-specific routing rules from the first version if implementation time is tight.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```productspec-acceptance-criteria
- id: AC-1
  criterion: New tickets receive urgency, customer tier, suggested owner, confidence score, and model version within 60 seconds.
- id: AC-2
  criterion: Reviewers can override any label before it changes downstream workflow state.
- id: AC-3
  criterion: Labels below 0.75 confidence are marked `needs_review` and do not trigger escalation.
- id: AC-4
  criterion: Every AI-generated label stores ticket ID, model version, input redaction status, confidence, reviewer action, and timestamp.
```

```productspec-ai-evals
- id: EVAL-1
  type: llm_judge
  cases:
    - input: "Enterprise customer reports that checkout has been down for 20 minutes and renewal is due tomorrow."
      expected: "Classify urgency as account_risk and recommend the owner queue responsible for checkout incidents."
    - input: "Small customer asks how to change invoice email recipients."
      expected: "Classify urgency as routine and do not escalate."
  evaluator: llm
  pass_threshold: 0.92
  checks:
    - urgency classification identifies account-risk tickets
    - owner recommendation matches the expected support queue
    - confidence below threshold is marked needs_review
- id: EVAL-2
  type: regex
  cases:
    - input: "Ticket includes user email sam@example.com, account token sk_live_123, and complaint about SSO failure."
      expected: "Model-visible context replaces private email and token values before classification."
    - input: "Ticket includes phone +1-415-555-1212 and account-risk language."
      expected: "Model-visible context preserves account-risk language while redacting the phone number."
  evaluator: deterministic
  pass_threshold: 1
  checks:
    - no private customer data appears in model-visible input
    - redaction placeholders preserve enough context for classification
```
