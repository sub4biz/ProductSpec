## Problem

A business owner running an AI agent on their customer conversations has no reliable way to get a human into a conversation the AI cannot finish. When a customer asks for a person, or an action needs approval, the conversation stalls or the owner has to watch every thread all day, which defeats the reason they bought an AI.

## Hypothesis

If the AI can hand a conversation to a named human with SLA tracking and full context, owners will let the AI run autonomously, because exceptions reliably reach a person. The owner's daily check becomes "47 handled by AI, 3 need attention" instead of reading every thread.

## Product Summary

A customer handoff workflow keeps CRM ownership and handoff context synchronized when accounts move between teams.

## Scope

```productspec-scope
in:
  - explicit handoff via a request_human_handoff tool
  - handoff records with SLA columns
  - assignment to a team or person, appearing in the inbox
out:
  - signal-triggered handoff, which waits on the risk-signals work
  - Do not build CRM owner sync in this version.
cut:
  - a separate copilot product with its own billing, rejected in favor of one agent with a mode setting
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```productspec-acceptance-criteria
- id: AC-1
  criterion: Calling request_human_handoff creates a handoff record with status pending and the conversation appears in the inbox.
- id: AC-2
  criterion: Assigning a handoff sets the assignee and starts the SLA clock.
- id: AC-3
  criterion: Routing operates on the conversation assignee and never on the CRM contact owner.
```

```productspec-ai-evals
- id: EVAL-1
  type: llm_judge
  cases:
    - input: "Customer writes: this is useless, let me talk to a real person."
      expected: "Agent calls request_human_handoff instead of continuing to answer."
  evaluator: llm
  pass_threshold: 0.9
```

## Open Questions

- The SM-1 and SM-2 targets are provisional because no baseline exists before launch. The Ops lead sets both from the first 30 days of real traffic.
