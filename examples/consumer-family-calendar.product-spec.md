## Problem

Parents coordinating shared family calendars miss school pickups, practices, and appointments because conflicts are only visible after someone opens the calendar.

## Hypothesis

If the calendar warns parents when a new event conflicts with an existing family obligation, families will resolve schedule conflicts earlier because the issue appears at the moment of planning.

## Product Summary

A family calendar assistant detects schedule conflicts, alerts the right caregiver, and shows enough context to resolve the conflict quickly.

## Scope

```productspec-scope
in:
  - Include shared calendar conflict detection in this version.
  - Include mobile push alert in this version.
  - Include conflict detail view in this version.
  - Include one-tap ask partner message in this version.
  - Include dismiss state in this version.
out:
  - Do not build automatic rescheduling in this version.
  - Do not build childcare booking in this version.
  - Do not build school calendar import in this version.
  - Do not build recurring-event cleanup in this version.
cut:
  - Cut location-aware travel-time conflicts from the first version if implementation time is tight.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```productspec-acceptance-criteria
- id: AC-1
  criterion: Creating or editing an event checks for overlapping events on selected family calendars.
- id: AC-2
  criterion: A detected conflict shows the conflicting event title, owner, time, and calendar.
- id: AC-3
  criterion: Parents can send a prefilled message to the other event owner from the conflict detail view.
- id: AC-4
  criterion: Dismissing a conflict suppresses duplicate alerts for the same event pair unless either event time changes.
- id: AC-5
  criterion: Private event titles remain hidden unless the viewer already has access to that calendar.
```
