## Problem

Revenue operations managers at mid-market SaaS companies lose planning time every Monday because dashboard data has to be manually copied into spreadsheet templates before the weekly revenue meeting.

## Hypothesis

If revenue operations managers can export the current dashboard view directly into the team's spreadsheet format, they will spend less time preparing recurring reporting packets because the dashboard becomes the source of the meeting artifact.

## Product Summary

A scheduled export workflow writes customer analytics into Google Sheets while leaving the post-launch target provisional until baseline data exists.

## Scope

```productspec-scope
in:
  - Let a user export saved dashboard views as CSV files.
  - Preserve the current dashboard table column order in the export.
  - Include applied filter and date range metadata in the export.
  - Record an audit event when an export is created.
out:
  - Do not build scheduled exports in this version.
  - Do not build Google Sheets writeback in this version.
  - Do not build custom spreadsheet templates in this version.
cut:
  - Cut PDF export from the first version if implementation time is tight.
  - Cut exports from unsaved ad hoc chart edits from the first version.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```productspec-acceptance-criteria
- id: AC-1
  criterion: A user with report access can export a saved dashboard view as CSV from the dashboard page.
- id: AC-2
  criterion: The exported file preserves visible column order, applied filters, and selected date range.
- id: AC-3
  criterion: When a user creates an export, the audit log records user ID, dashboard ID, filter hash, timestamp, and row count.
- id: AC-4
  criterion: Users without report access cannot export the dashboard and see the existing permission error state.
```

## Open Questions

- Revenue operations lead will replace `target: tbd` for SM-1 after the first two post-launch meetings establish the baseline packet-preparation time.
