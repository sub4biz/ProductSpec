## Problem

Support leads at B2B SaaS companies lose their morning planning window because urgent, account-risk tickets are buried among routine product questions.

## Hypothesis

If incoming tickets are automatically labeled by urgency, customer tier, and likely owner, support leads will respond to account-risk issues faster because the queue starts each day pre-sorted by consequence.

## Product Summary

This Product Spec describes the product behavior, user-facing shape, and implementation boundaries for the work.

## Scope

```productspec-scope
in:
  - Include ticket ingestion in this version.
  - Include urgency labels in this version.
  - Include customer-tier lookup in this version.
  - Include owner recommendation in this version.
  - Include confidence score in this version.
  - Include reviewer override in this version.
out:
  - Do not build auto-replies in this version.
  - Do not build direct ticket reassignment in this version.
cut:
  - Cut custom routing rules from the first version if implementation time is tight.
```

## User Experience

Reviewer console showing each new ticket with urgency, customer tier, suggested owner, confidence score, and an override control.

## Acceptance Criteria

```productspec-acceptance-criteria
- id: AC-1
  criterion: New tickets receive urgency, customer tier, suggested owner, confidence score, and model version within 60 seconds.
- id: AC-2
  criterion: Reviewers can override urgency, customer tier, or suggested owner before downstream workflow state changes.
```

```productspec-ai-evals
- id: EVAL-1
  type: llm_judge

    - input: "Customer says their renewal is blocked because SSO has been down for two days."
      expected: "Classify as high urgency with account-risk rationale."
    - input: "Customer asks where to find the invoice export setting."
      expected: "Classify as normal urgency unless customer tier or context indicates account risk."
  evaluator: llm
  pass_threshold: 0.9
```
